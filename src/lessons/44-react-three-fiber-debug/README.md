# Debugging with R3F / React

- enable strict mode
- wrap the <Canvas> in a <StrictMode>
- potential errors are shown as warnings in terminal
- strictmode is for dev mode, but in published mode, its removed
- install react-dev-tools -> developer tools -> components tab
- goto the settings for component -> components -> disable filter type (OFF) -> gives access to the messhes in component tab

```js
//index.js
import { StrictMode } from "react";

root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <Canvas></Canvas>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

### debug ui with Leva (made by react) 12min20sec

- made by PMNDRS team
- npm i leva@0.9
- you can put it in any component
- each change in debug ui, rerender occurs
- we can destructure it in order to get only the position
- can use it in position-x attribute of mesh
- instead of input, we can have input range: send an object with specific properties to the position of the useControls

```js
import {useControls} from 'leva';

//...

// const {position} = useControls({position: -2});
const {position} = useControls({position: {
  value: -2,
  min:-4,
  max:4,
  step:0.01
}});

//...
<mesh position-x={position}>

```

### Range (22min 22sec)

A range - can be done by sending an object with specific properties to the position of the useControls:

```js
const { position } = useControls({
  position: {
    value: { x: -2, y: 0, z: 0 },
    step: 0.01,
  },
});
```

### Color (28min 40sec)
- can specify with string.
- can use a strong but the alpha channel wont work because threejs handles this with "opacity" and "transparent" properties

### Leva configuration

First, we need to add the component ourselves to our application so that we can tweak its attributes.

We canâ€™t add it in the Experience because it is inside <Canvas> and everything in <Canvas> is intended for R3F. Instead, we need to add it in the index.jsx file outside of the <Canvas>.

- this allows us to use attributes like: `<Leva collapsed />`

In index.jsx, import Leva from leva:

```js
import { Leva } from "leva";

root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <Leva />
    <Canvas
      camera={{
        fov: 45,
        near: 0.1,
        far: 50,
        position: [-4, 3, 6],
      }}
    >
      <Experience />
    </Canvas>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

### monitoring r3f-perf (44min)

- you can use Stats.js
- alt made by @onirenaud - more advanced solution for r3f - R3F-Perf

```console
npm install r3f-perf@7.1
```

```js
import { Perf } from "r3f-perf";
export default function Experience() {
  // ...

  return (
    <>
      <Perf position="top-left" />

      {/* ... */}
    </>
  );
}
```
