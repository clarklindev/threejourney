# Physics

- you can create your own physics with mathematics and solutions like Raycaster
- use a library if you want realistic physics with tension, friction, bouncing, constraints, pivots.

### PARALLEL WORLDS

- create a physics world (ethereal - can not see this)
- create a threejs 3d world
- when we add an object to the threejs world, we also add one in the physics world
- update threejs world - on each frame, we let the physics world update iself and we update the threejs world accordingly

### physics libraries

- 3d or 2d?
  - can reduce 3d experience to 2d eg. there is no height (eg pool or pinball)

### 3d

- cannon.js (mentor pick - easier to understand)
- ammo.js (mentor pick - most popular)
- oimo.js

### 2d

- matter.js
- p2.js
- planck.js
- box2d.js

### combines threejs with physics

- physi.js

### installing cannonjs

```cmd
npm i cannon
```

```js
import CANNON from "cannon";
```
